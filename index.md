### Learning

I'm now learning some programming and also using Linux kernel, specifically Ubuntu 20.04 OS

The languages i am learning or have learned (a little) are:
* C++
* Python
* Java
* Html/Css

The languages/stuff i want to learn
* Java OOP
* C++ OOP & C
* Assembly (or not)
* Software Development **and/or** Backend Development


**Why C++?** </br>
I like the syntax and it's just my favorite
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```


**Why not python?** </br>
Too short
```
print("Hello world!")
```


**Why learn Java?** </br>
MMM i don't really know yet, i haven't learn much about it but this is the "Hello world!"
```
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```


### Projects

My projects are mostly still learning projects
I do programming courses problem set at </br>
[TLX](https://toki.tlx.id)</br>
[Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/)</br>

For example, this is my Atcoder beginners contest task a submission
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int k;

int main(){
    cin >> k;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    {
        cout << "ACL";
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
input
```
4
```
output
```
ACLACLACLACL
```


### Contribution Target
**Translation** </br>
My Contribution target(s) are to translate, edit, and improve translation, also `.md ` files.</br>

My favorite contribution subject is to add rescourses, and create new translation, my translation although not format correct, are broadly understandable by majority of people in my country (atleast that what i think).
</br>

I try to not use complicated words and use the international word rather then the official translation, as it is relatively more used in my country. For example "gawai" that means "gadget" most people know gadget by the english word rather then the officially translated.
</br>

Other example is "game" as in Indonesia is "gim", also "mouse" as in Indonesia is "tetikus". Most people use the word "game" and "mouse" to not complicate the language, although not correct it's the most efficient for communication purposes.
